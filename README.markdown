# ~julien

Contains my custom configuration files for zsh, vim, git, etc. The dot files are based on [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)

## Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with minor fiddling. You'll need to switch to ZSH with the following command:

    $ chsh -s /bin/zsh

## Installation

Clone the repo

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone git@github.com:juliengrimault/dotjulien.git ~/.dotjulien
    $ cd .dotjulien

Install the dotfiles

    $ rake install

## And Now?

Enjoy.
